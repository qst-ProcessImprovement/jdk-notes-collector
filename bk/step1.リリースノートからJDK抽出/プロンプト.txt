install/install
➜ Sign oracle.com JDK RPM Packages with OL9 Signing Key (JDK-8351906 (not public))
The oracle.com JDK RPM packages meant to be downloaded directly to the target system, now are signed with the OL9 signing key instead of the OL8 signing key. The RPM packages hosted on YUM repositories remain signed with the appropriate key for the target repository.


core-libs/java.net
➜ java.net.http.HttpClient Is Enhanced to Report HTTP/2 Flow Control Errors to the Server (JDK-8342075)
The java.net.http.HttpClient will now report HTTP/2 flow control errors to the server when they are detected. This is an implementation detail that should be transparent to users of the HttpClient API, but could result in streams being reset or connections being closed if connecting to a non-conformant HTTP/2 server.


security-libs/java.security
➜ Updated HSS/LMS Public Key Encoding (JDK-8347596)
The X.509 encoded format for HSS/LMS public keys has been updated to align with the latest standard outlined in RFC 9708. Notably, the additional OCTET STRING wrapping around the public key value has been removed. For compatibility, public key encodings generated by earlier JDK releases are still recognized.


security-libs/java.security
➜ Compatible OCSP readtimeout Property with OCSP Timeout (JDK-8347506)
In JDK 21, an enhanced syntax for various timeout properties was released through JDK-8179502. This included a new system property, com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout, which allows users to control the timeout while reading OCSP responses after a successful TCP connection has been established.

This changes the default posture of this property to be the value of the com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout system property from its original default of 15 seconds. If the com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout system property is also not set, then its default 15 second timeout is propagated to the default for com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout.


security-libs/jdk.security
➜ Jarsigner Should Print a Warning If an Entry Is Removed (JDK-8309841)
If an entry is removed from a signed JAR file, there is no mechanism to detect that it has been removed using the JarFile API, since the getJarEntry method returns null as if the entry had never existed. With this change, the jarsigner -verify command analyzes the signature files and if some sections do not have matching file entries, it prints out the following warning: "This JAR contains signed entries for files that do not exist". Users can further find out the names of these entries by adding the -verbose option to the command.

 

Bug Fixes
This release also contains fixes for security vulnerabilities described in the Oracle Critical Patch Update.
